// Write your code here
//1. Create a class for Breakfast. Breakfast will have a constructor with a food and a drink.
class Breakfast{
  constructor(food, drink) {
    this.food = food,
    this.drink = drink
  }
};
Create a class for Lunch. Lunch will have a constructor with a salad, a soup, and a drink.
Create a class for Dinner. Since dinner is a little bit fancier, Dinner will have a constructor with salad, soup, entree, and dessert. Indicate that dessert is intended to be a private property by including an underscore (_) at the beginning.
